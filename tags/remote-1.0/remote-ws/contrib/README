Re-Mote Webservice Contrib Area
===============================

This directory contains unsorted and contributed stuff, which does not
fit into the main distribution, but may still be of interest to someone.
You will find here example configuration files and other small
utilities.  Note that this stuff is mostly unmaintained and is not
guaranteed to work.

 - soapmonitor: WSDD files for use with the SOAPMonitor application.
