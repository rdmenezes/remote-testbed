	<h3>Web Service for Client Authentication.</h3>
	<p>

	This package provides a service clients can use to authenticate
	a newly started session. Usually, the client will first create a
	connection to the mote control server (MCS), and MCS will in
	turn return a session ID, which the client is required to
	authenticate via this web service before it is allowed to send
	requests to the MCS.

	</p>
	<p><b>Session Authentication</b></p>
	<p>

	The client should perform the following steps in order to
	authenticate a session:

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>

		Open connection to MCS and store the session ID.

		</li>
		<li>
	
		Invoke the getEmptyCredentials() method for this service
		to get a set of empty credentials. These can be used by
		a user interface to query the actual user if the client
		is running in interactive mode.

		</li>
		<li>

		Invoke the authenticate() method of this service to
		authenticate the session with with the passed session ID
		using the (non-empty) credentials, which should belong
		to a valid account on the system.

		</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Notes</b></p>
	<p>

	If the client writes to the MCS connection before it has
	authenticated the session ID it got, MCS will shut down the
	connection.

	</p>
	<p>

	The webservice permits multiple variations of the number of
	credential fields clients should provide and clients should
	support this gracefully. It can choose not support all possible
	combinations. Clients should assume that credentials that have
	been marked hidden may contain information sensitive to the user
	and they should process these credentials accordingly.
