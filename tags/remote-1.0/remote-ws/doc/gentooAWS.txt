Java
====
emerge -v sun-jdk
java-config -L


Tomcat
======
emerge -v tomcat

I decided to go with this choice even though more general approach of 
installation described in boot-howto.txt is recommended.

Gentoo distribution take care of almost everything and you end up with
running two commands

rc-update add default tomcat-5.5 
/etc/init.d/tomcat-5.5 start

Configuration
-------------
/etc/tomcat-5.5

TODO:
server.xml
tomcat-users.xml

Container
---------
/var/lib/tomcat-5.5

TODO:
general description

Additional libraries
--------------------
/usr/share/tomcat-5.5/common/lib

TODO:
description of other libraries needed for Re-Mote


Axis
====
emerge -v axis

Since Gentoo distro comes with Axis 1.3, I decided to obtain Axis
from http://ws.apache.org/axis/. All what you need is just to copy
webapps/axis folder from archive into the tomcat's world which is

/var/lib/tomcat-5.5/

TODO:
description of other libraries needed for AXIS
configuration of server-config.wsdd, users.lst, web.xml
