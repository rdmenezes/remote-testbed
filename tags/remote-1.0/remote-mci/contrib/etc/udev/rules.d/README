Re-Mote UDEV rules
------------------

This directory contains UDEV rules files for hooking into the userspace
device event system and create device symlinks and run mote setup
scripts. The following naming scheme should be used:

	<priority>-remote-<platform>-<task>.rules

Where:

 - `<platform>` is the name of the mote platform in lower case, eg.
   `dig528-2`.
 - `<task>` is either `symlink` or `run`.
 - `<priority>` depends on `<task>` and should be `65` for `symlink`
   rules and `85` for `run` rules.

As an example, the dig528-2 platform uses the following rules:

	65-remote-dig528-2-symlink.rules
	85-remote-dig528-2-run.rules

The main motivation for splitting up the tasks is to give the `symlink`
rules a priority that ensures they are invoked before the `run` rules,
which depends on the existence of mote device symlinks.

No well defined priority scheme seems to have been designed UDEV,
however, Debian uses the following scheme, which has been adopted for
this project:

	00   rules that it is critical to be run first, usually
	     only WAIT_FOR_SYSFS

	20   rules that change the name from the device from the default
	     (cannot be overriden)

	40   rules that set the permissions of device nodes
	     (can be overriden by later rules)

	60   rules that add symlinks to device nodes
	     (adds to those set in earlier rules)

	80   rules that run programs (but do not load modules)

	90   rules that load modules

	99   rules that it is critical to be run last

	This scheme has been chosen so that user-supplied rules are
	normally named 50-*.rules for the right thing to happen.

	Packages should chose the approriate sequence point and add 5 to
	it unless there is a need for a particular order.
