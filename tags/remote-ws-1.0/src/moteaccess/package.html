	<h3>Web Service for Acquiring Mote Access and Control Privilege.</h3>
	<p>

	This web service provides clients with an interface for taking
	control over motes. The set of motes the client wants to get
	access to can either be chosen by a user if the client runs in
	interactive mode, or can be preconfigured if the client runs in
	automated mode. For each mote that are queried using
	getMoteControlPrivileges(), an associated boolean value is
	returned indicating whether the privileges were granted for the
	mote or denied.
