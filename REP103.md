# General Purpose Java library #

This enhancement proposal is a design document for the specification and implementation of a Java library for accessing and extending the framework by making new services accessible. Part of the effort is to better document the different components that are involved in mote control and accessing testbed services. The library should make it easy to writing new Java based clients or integrate Re-Mote into an existing program.

## Introduction ##

The main goal of the library is to create the basic infrastructure needed for a client. The client should be written in such a general way that it supports client on different platforms and using different workflows.

Currently, the Re-Mote client implements something equivalent to what the library is trying to provide, but it is not very well contained. A better solution is to create a completely stand-alone client library.

## Details ##

The library consists of a set of packages that provide APIs that can be used by clients for connecting to testbeds. In the following, an overview of the various design decisions are presented.

### Versioning ###

To support future updates to the APIs, most importantly services that involve the communication with the testbed server, the library and API is versioned in such a way that it will be easier to update a service provider to support the changes. Do

### Library Structure ###

...

### Mote Information and Control ###

The most important function of this library is the API provided for mote control. The rest is more or less just a mean to achieve this. For certain mote operations an authenticated session is required.

### Session Management ###

All operations happens withint the context of a session. Most of this is hidden in the mote control interfaces, however, any implementation needs to keep track of this relation "behind the scene".

### Service Management ###

One service per sub-package? - Services are modelled on the services of remote-1.x and the way in which the remote-1.x client works.
Asynchronous vs. Blocking APIs

The APIs of this library is designed to support as many different work-flows as possible. This means that both blocking and asynchronous, web-based etc. Axis supports asynchronous and AJAX web applications (GWT) are inherently asynchronous. Two concepts are used: - Listeners: One listner pr. object, one completion event/method per call. - Callbacks: One callback handler per call/method.

### Abstraction layers and types ###

Layering means that some types will be represented at different layers from codes exchanged over the network protocols to values exposed to the high-level mote control command results.
