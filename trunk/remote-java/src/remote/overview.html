<h1>Re·Mote Testbed Framework Java Library</h1>
<p>

This library consists of a set of packages that provides
APIs that can be used by clients for connecting to testbeds
using the
<a href="http://remote-testbed.googlecode.com">Re·Mote Testbed Framework</a>.

In the following, overall design decisions are presented.

</p>

<h2> Mote Information and Control </h2>
<p>

The most important function of this library is the API
provided for mote control.

For certain mote operations an authenticated session is
required.

</p>

<h2> Session Management </h2>
<p>

</p>

<h2> Service Management </h2>
<p>

</p>

<h2> Asynchronous vs. Blocking APIs </h2>
<p>

The APIs of this library is designed to support as many different
work-flows as possible. This means that both blocking and asynchronous,
web-based etc.

</p>

<h2> Versioned APIs </h2>
<p>

To support future updates to the APIs, most importantly services
that involve the communication with the testbed server, the library
and API is versioned in such a way that it will be easier to update
a service provider to support the changes.
