Thinstation packaging for DIKU
------------------------------

Some of this could be in the contrib/ area. Configuration files already
exist.

 - remote-mci (setup.sh)
 - bootloader for the motes: hcs08prg (setup.h + tarball)
	/media/sda4/DIKU/diku/old/sensor-network/tmp/tinyos/bootloader-v6-host
	.. more recent source
 - boost

Portability
-----------

 - Conditionally #include header files based on config/config.h

Cleanups
--------

 - printf -> log
