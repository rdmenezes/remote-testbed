TODO
====

This file contains various minor and major tasks that should be done in
the future. It also serves as a "scratch pad" for things that should be
investigated further.

Hotplug
-------

Should be changed to use udev (which seems to be more powerful)

 - Hotplug scripts in setup/ directories.

 - diku_mch/plugpiper/plugpiper.c: program which writes simply "p"
   to the /var/run/motehost.events;

 - diku_mch/DeviceManager.cc:

	00049  // create a regular expression to match the desired information per device
	00050  regx = ".*?T: .*?Bus=([0-9]*).*?Prnt=([0-9]*) Port=([0-9]*).*?Dev#=[ ]*([0-9]*).*?(^[ ]*$|SerialNumber=([^\\n]*)).*";

Thinstation packaging for DIKU
------------------------------

Some of this could be in the contrib/ area. Configuration files already
exist.

 - remote-mci (setup.sh)
 - bootloader for the motes: hcs08prg (setup.h + tarball)
	/media/sda4/DIKU/diku/old/sensor-network/tmp/tinyos/bootloader-v6-host
	.. more recent source
 - boost

Portability
-----------

 - Conditionally #include header files based on config/config.h

Cleanups
--------

 - printf -> log
