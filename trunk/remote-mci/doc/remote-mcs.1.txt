=============

NAME
----
remote-mcs - Re-Mote mote control server

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The mote control server manages connections from mote control hosts and user
clients and operates mainly as a "switch" by forwarding message from clients
to host with motes controlled by the colient. On startup the server cleans up
the database by removing stale session, mote, and site data and starts
listening for incoming connections from mote hosts and clients.

The mote control server may be run both in the foreground and as a daemon.
