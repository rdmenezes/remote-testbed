REMOTE-MCS(1)
=============

NAME
----
remote-mcs - Re-Mote mote control server

SYNOPSIS
--------
remote-mcs [options]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The mote control server manages connections from mote control hosts and user
clients and operates mainly as a "switch" by forwarding message from clients
to host with motes controlled by the colient. On startup the server cleans up
the database by removing stale session, mote, and site data and starts
listening for incoming connections from mote hosts and clients.

The mote control server may be run both in the foreground and as a daemon.

OPTIONS
-------
The following options are only usable on the command line.

--config=<path>::

	Path to the configuration file. Defaults to "/etc/remote-mcs.cfg".

--help::

	Print usage help and exit.

--version::

	Print version info and exit.

Configuration options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In addition, to the above options the mote control server accepts the
following configuration options that can be specified either on the command
line or in the configuration file. An option set in the configuration file
overrides any option set on the command line.

On the command line use: '--' <name> '=' <value>, e.g. '--devicePath=/here'.
In the config file use: <name> '=' <value>, e.g. 'devicePath=/here'. For
boolean options the '=' and value may be left out to set the value to true.
See the example sections for more information.

/etc/remote-mcs.cfg::

	Default configuration file read on startup.

/var/run/remote-mcs.pid::

	Default PID file path.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
The mote control server does not use any environment variables.

EXAMPLES
--------

Using configuration options on the command line::

	If you only need to override the default values for the database
	access and don't want to use a configuration file, specify all
	option on the command line.

	$ remote-mcs --dbName=REMOTE --dbUser=remote_admin --dbPassword=123

A simple configuration file::

	The following configuration file sets the same values as the above
	example and also tells the mote control server to run as a daemon.

	# Database credentials
	dbName=REMOTE
	dbUser=remote_admin
	dbPassword=123
	# Run in the background
	daemonize
