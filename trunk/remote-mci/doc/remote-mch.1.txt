DESCRIPTION
-----------
The mote control host manages mote devices and provides remote access to them
through a mote control server. On startup the mote host connects to the server
and listens for incoming requests. Requests allows motes to be programmed,
started, stopped, and reset. All console output from motes are forwarded to
the server.

The mote control host may be run both in the foreground and as a daemon.

	Run as a daemon. Default is to not daemonize.

--help::

	Print usage help and exit.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

Use the following options to configure the mote host.

devicePath <string>::

	Path to the mote device hierarchy.
	When not specified "/dev/remote/" is used.

usbPlugEventPipe <string>::

For each mote managed by the mote host, the following device specific files
are used. The device path is configurable (default: "/dev/remote"). MOTEMAC
represents the MAC address of a mote.

/dev/remote/MOTEMAC/programmer::

	Symbolic link to the mote programmer. The programmer is called
	with the TTY as the first argument and path to the image file
	as the second argument.

/dev/remote/MOTEMAC/controller::

	Symbolic link to the mote control program.

/dev/remote/MOTEMAC/tty/control::

	Symbolic link to the mote control TTY.

/dev/remote/MOTEMAC/tty/data::

	Symbolic link to the mote data TTY.

/dev/remote/MOTEMAC/image::

	Temporary image file used when programming.

/dev/remote/MOTEMAC/path::

	File containing the mote device path in the form of a path specifying
	the bus ID. E.g. "/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:10.0/usb2/2-1".

/dev/remote/MOTEMAC/platform::
