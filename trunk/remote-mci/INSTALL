Installation Instructions
=========================

Before begining, check that the following dependencies are met.

Mote control server:
 - MySQL C library (>= 5.0.45)
 - MySQL C++ library (>= 2.0.7)
 - Boost program options library (>= 1.34.1)

Mote control host:
 - Udev (>= 113)
 - Boost program options library (>= 1.34.1)

Note that both the library binaries and header files (often packaged
separately) needs to be installed.

If you are building from an SVN or git checkout, first run the bootstrap
script to generate the build files.

	$ ./bootstrap

Configure what you would like to build. Usually, it is enough to just run
configure. Pass the --help option to list which options and environment
variables can be used. The following example shows how to only build the mote
control host program with the boost library installed in a custom location:

	$ ./configure --prefix=/ --bindir=/sbin \
		      --disable-mcs CXXFLAGS=-I/usr/include/boost-1_33/

Verify that the configuration summary printed at the end of the script
execution corresponds to your requirements.

Build all configured programs:

	$ make

To install on the local system to the location provided with the --prefix
option, run:

	$ make install

You should also install an start up script (e.g. into /etc/init.d/) so the
mote control host and server is started when the system is booted. Examples
for different systems are provided in the contrib directory.
