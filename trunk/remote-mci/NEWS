Re-Mote MCI now
===============

 - Add Autoconf/Automake based buildsystem to ease building for small
   environments. This allows automatic detection of the major library
   dependencies and allows for cross-compilation as well as other of the
   portability features of using Autotools.

 - Populate the tree with files, such as NEWS, README, COPYING, etc.
   Many of which are required by Automake.

 - Use one common Doxygen configuration file for building code
   documentation.

 - Create new contrib area that provides examples and other utilities.
   Add udev example script as an alternative to using hotplug.
