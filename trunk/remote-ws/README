The Re-Mote WebServices
=======================

This package contains the files for building and deploying the
webservice components used by Re-Mote.

The Java classes responsible of the server specific part of the services
are in the src/ directory. The web service deployment descriptors are in
wsdd. Both of the above are used for generating WSDL files describing
the services made available. Using the WSDL files, client Java classes
for accessing the webservices can then be created and compiled for use
by the Re-Mote client. Jar files are located in lib/ and contain
dependencies for making the various conversions and for compiling the
server and client specific packages.
