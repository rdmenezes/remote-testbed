TODO
====

This file contains various minor and major tasks that should be done in
the future. It also serves as a "scratch pad" for things that should be
investigated further.


New features
------------

 - Add support for displaying the mote platform, e.g. DIG528, Tmote, and
   micaz.


Issues / bugs
-------------

 - Automatically mirror the status of controlled motes in the "All
   motes" pane. Currently, this is only done when the refresh button is
   pressed.
