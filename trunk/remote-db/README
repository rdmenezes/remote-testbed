The Re-Mote Database Scripts
============================

This package contains scripts for setting up and managing the database
used by the Re-Mote mote control server and webservices. It consists of
four modules:

  remote_core			Core tables for the testbed framework.
  user_model			User and project specific tables and scripts.
  reservation_model		Mote reservation tables.
  diku_specific_infrastructure	Tables and scripts specific to DIKU.


Setting up the database
-----------------------

By default the database will be named "REMOTE" with privileges granted
to the user named "remote_admin" having the password "remote". This is
all done in remote_core/scripts/create_remote_db.sql, which should be
run first when creating a new database for a testbed.

	Note, if you change the username or password, you should also
	change the user_model/scripts/credential.sh script to mirror
	what you changed.

Create the database by running the command:

	$ mysql < remote_core/scripts/create_remote_db.sql

as a user, who has write privileges, e.g. root.

After creating the database, create the tables using the supplied script
and specifying the username, password, and database on the command line:

	$ mysql --user=remote_admin \
		--password=remote \
		REMOTE < remote_core/scripts/create_tables.sql

Then create the tables for the user mode:

	$ mysql --user=remote_admin \
		--password=remote \
		REMOTE < user_model/scripts/create_tables.sql

Finally, set up the site specific tables and attribute associations.
For DIKU this amounts to:

	$ mysql --user=remote_admin \
		--password=remote \
		REMOTE < diku_specific_infrastructure/scripts/create_tables.sql

and:

	$ mysql --user=remote_admin \
		--password=remote \
		REMOTE < diku_specific_infrastructure/scripts/insert_attribute_types.sql
