The Re-Mote Mote Control Infrastructure
=======================================

The mote control infrastructure consists of a mote server daemon written
in C++, a relational database based on MySQL, and a mote information
server based on Apache Tomcat. The host software is application
dependent. In the actual deployment, there is a host daemon keeping
track of connected motes, along with a customized USB to serial driver
and a flash programming utility.

The mote control infrastructure is part of the Re-Mote Testbed
Framework, which is a collection of modules for providing remote access
to WSN testbeds.
