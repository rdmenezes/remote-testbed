None of the ideas and suggestions on this page carry any meaning other than give a basis for the future planning of version 2 of the Re-Mote Testbed Framework.

[http://code.google.com/p/remote-testbed/issues/list?q=label:Milestone-Release2.0 Some issues] have already been assigned to this milestone.

 * [http://ws.apache.org/axis2/1_3/migration.html Move to Axis 2] as the platform for client RPC

 * Combine the DB and WS components into one all-in-on server module. Can later be followed with control libraries from the GUI component that are going to be needed for running jobs on the server.
