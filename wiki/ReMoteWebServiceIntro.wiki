= The Re-Mote Web Services =

This package contains the files for building and deploying the
webservice components used by Re-Mote. It also

It has the following structure:

 * *lib:* Jar files containing dependencies for making the various conversions and for compiling the server and client specific libraries.
 * *src:* Java classes responsible of the server specific part of the services.
 * *wsdd:* The web service deployment descriptors.

== The Build Process ==

Both of the above are used for generating WSDL files describing
the services made available. Using the WSDL files, client Java classes
for accessing the webservices can then be created and compiled for use
by the Re-Mote client.

 * Something about the Makefile rules for deploying. Saying that they
   are best for localhost?

== Installation ==

 # Start out with the axis/ template from the axis-bin-1.4 release.

 # Modify server.xml

Note, while changes in the axis specific configuration files will
automatically be noticed by tomcat, always remember to restart
tomcat after changing the `server.xml` file.

== Testing the Deployment ==

 * Using SOAPMonitor, contrib/soapmonitor/

 * Using tcpmon

 * Checking the tomcat logs (catalina.out)
