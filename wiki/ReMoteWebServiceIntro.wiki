 * *src:* Java classes responsible of the server specific part of the services.
 * *wsdd:* The web service deployment descriptors.

Both of the above are used for generating WSDL files describing
the services made available. Using the WSDL files, client Java classes
for accessing the webservices can then be created and compiled for use
by the Re-Mote client.
