= Getting the Source Code ==

The source code is available either as [http://code.google.com/p/remote-testbed/downloads/list downloadable release archives] or using one of the repositories described below. The released archives are generally more stable, but may lack important features and fixes. If you want to keep in sync with the latest source of the framework getting the source from one of the repository below is recommended. It also allows you to easily keep track of any local changes you make and makes it easier to contribute code back to the project.

== DIKU Repositories ==

The primary version control system used for managing the DIKU source code tree is [http://git.or.cz/ git]. The SVN repository is updated in a one-way fashion and provided mainly for easing distribution. Read about how this is done in SvnSynchronization.

*[http://code.google.com/p/remote-testbed/source The SVN repository] [http://code.google.com/p/remote-testbed/source/browse/trunk (browse)] [http://code.google.com/p/remote-testbed/source/list (changes)]*

  This SVN repository is periodically synchronized with the git repositories. In other words, the newest changes are always available first in the git repositories. As of around 2007-11-01 the SvnSynchronization process tries to mirror the history as good as possible.

*[http://repo.or.cz/w/remote.git The git repositories] [http://repo.or.cz/w/remote/remote-mci.git (MCI)] [http://repo.or.cz/w/remote/remote-db.git (DB)] [http://repo.or.cz/w/remote/remote-ws.git (WS)] [http://repo.or.cz/w/remote/remote-gui.git (GUI)]*

  The git repositories are publicly available at [http://repo.or.cz/ repo.or.cz], where the repositories can be browsed via gitweb and where you are free to create and host your own "fork" of each of these repositories. Instructions on how to clone the different repositories are provided on each of the module pages.

== CIT Repositories ==

*[http://testbed.aws.cit.ie/dev/remote/ CIT git repositories]*

  Rosta maintains git repositories with CIT specific changes at http://testbed.aws.cit.ie/dev/remote/, all clonable via the HTTP transport.
