=== remote-db ===

 * Issue 3: Add mote platform attribute. The priority should probably be higher than tosaddress and macaddress?

 * Issue 5: Prepare for IPv6 support.

=== remote-ws ===

 * Issue 1: Prevent possible SQL injection attacks. All queries should be changed to use `PreparedStatement`.

=== remote-mci ===

 * Issue 2: Fix problems with mysql++ usage being incompatible across different versions of the library. *(STARTED)* (JF)

 * Issue 3: MCH should read mote platform via mote device file, send the information to MCS, which should put it in the database as a mote attribute.

 * Issue 6: Make MCH support the use of external programs to control mote start, stop, and reset, similar to how programming is currently done via an external program.

 * Issue 7: Add support Tmote and MicaZ.

 * Update INSTALL file to state which versions of dependencies such as libraries are required.

=== remote-gui ===

 * Issue 3: Display mote platform in the mote panes.

 * Issue 4: Update state of control motes in the all motes pane. This will not require any round-trip time, only an update of data already in the client.

 * Remove/disable the "motes map", since it is unlikely to be ready for this release.
