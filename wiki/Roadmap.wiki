For each milestone, tasks that should be made for each of the different modules are listed. Where the changes relates to existing issues this is mentioned, and more details for the task will exist in the comments of the specified issue. Any task of "a significant size" should have its own issues, and issues should always be created when a task involves several modules.

Each task listed should contain one of the following strings to describe its status. When possible, the status should reflect that of the associated issue.

 * *(STARTED)*: meaning implementation is in progress.
 * *(DONE)* meaning the change has been implemented, tested, and is ready.

Tasks that have been assigned to a developer can be noted by adding the developer's initials.

=== remote-db ===

 * Issue 3: Add mote platform attribute. The priority should probably be higher than tosaddress and macaddress?

=== remote-ws ===

 * Issue 1: Prevent possible SQL injection attacks. All queries should be changed to use `PreparedStatement`. *(STARTED)* (JF)

=== remote-mci ===

 * Issue 2: Fix problems with mysql++ usage being incompatible across different versions of the library. *(STARTED)* (JF)

 * Issue 3: MCH should read mote platform via mote device file, send the information to MCS, which should put it in the database as a mote attribute.

 * Issue 6: Make MCH support the use of external programs to control mote start, stop, and reset, similar to how programming is currently done via an external program.

 * Update INSTALL file to state which versions of dependencies such as libraries are required.

=== remote-gui ===

 * Issue 3: Display mote platform in the mote panes.

 * Issue 4: Update state of control motes in the all motes pane. This will not require any round-trip time, only an update of data already in the client.

 * Remove/disable the "motes map", since it is unlikely to be ready for this release.
