= Developing Re-Mote =

This document is currently mostly a placeholder. It should be expanded as needed to cover important aspects related to the development of Re-Mote.

== Getting the Source Code ==

Several repositories exists allowing you to choose your preferred way of getting the latest SourceCode.

== Release Planning ==

The RoadMap contains the plan of future major milestones and uses the [http://code.google.com/p/remote-testbed/issues/list issue tracker] to manage the different tasks. Additional [http://code.google.com/p/remote-testbed/w/list?q=label:Type-Proposal design documents] may exist from time to time, detailing enhancement proposals.

== The Build Process ==

Both of the above are used for generating WSDL files describing
the services made available. Using the WSDL files, client Java classes
for accessing the webservices can then be created and compiled for use
by the Re-Mote client.

 * Something about the Makefile rules for deploying. Saying that they are best for localhost?

== Testing the Deployment ==

The web services can be tested:

 * Using SOAPMonitor, see contrib/soapmonitor/ in `remote-ws`.
 * Using tcpmon
