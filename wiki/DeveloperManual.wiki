= Developing Re-Mote =

This document is currently mostly a placeholder. It should be expanded as needed to cover important aspects related to the development of Re-Mote.

== Getting the Source Code ==

Several repositories exists allowing you to choose your preferred way of getting the latest SourceCode. Note that the primary version control system used for managing the official Re-Mote source code is [http://git.or.cz/ git]. The [http://code.google.com/p/remote-testbed/source SVN repository] is updated in a "write-only" one-way fashion and provided mainly for easing distribution. Read about how this is done in SvnSynchronization.

== Release Planning ==

The RoadMap contains the plan of future major milestones and uses the [http://code.google.com/p/remote-testbed/issues/list issue tracker] to manage the different tasks. Additional [http://code.google.com/p/remote-testbed/w/list?q=label:Phase-RFC design documents] may exist from time to time, detailing enhancement proposals.
