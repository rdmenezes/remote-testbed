= Developing Re-Mote =

This document is currently mostly a placeholder. It should be expanded as needed to cover important aspects related to the development of Re-Mote.

== Code Repositories ==

To get the latest version of the source code, use either the [http://code.google.com/p/remote-testbed/source SVN repository] or the [http://repo.or.cz/w/remote.git git repositories]. The primary version control system used for managing Re-Mote is [http://git.or.cz/ git]. This means that the newest changes are always available first in the git repositories which is then periodically synchronized with the SVN repository. The SvnSynchronization process tries (as of around 2007-11-01) to mirror the history as good as can be done.
