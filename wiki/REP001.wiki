#summary Structure and template for enhancement proposals
#labels Section-Proposal,Type-BCP,Status-Draft

This REP (Re-Mote Enhancement Proposal) contains guidelines for how a proposal should be structured and formatted and may serve as a template for new proposals. Although somewhat informal, it is recommended that new REPs be based on this template and simply "fill in the blanks".

Put the (human-readable) title in the `#summary`. All proposals must have the `Section-REP` label applied. Also add a proper `Status` and `Type` labels.

Before the introduction, provide a short abstract summarizing the motivation factors and proposed solution.
